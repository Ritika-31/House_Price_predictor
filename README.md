# House_Price_predictor
A house price predictor for Bangalore typically involves predicting the price of a house based on various factors such as location, size (in square feet), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, amenities, and other relevant features. 
Here's a description of the tech stack and methods commonly used in building such predictors:

Tech Stack:

Python: Python is a popular choice for building machine learning models due to its extensive libraries and frameworks for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, often used for handling structured data such as CSV files or database tables.
NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a versatile machine learning library that provides various tools for data mining and analysis. It includes algorithms for regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Matplotlib and Seaborn are plotting libraries used for data visualization in Python. They allow you to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations to explore data and communicate insights.
Flask or Django: Flask and Django are popular web frameworks for Python. You can use one of these frameworks to create a web application for users to interact with your house price predictor model.
Methods:

Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Data preprocessing ensures that the data is in a suitable format for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones or transforming features to improve the performance of the model. For example, you might create new features such as the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms or the age of the property.
Model Selection: Selecting an appropriate machine learning model is crucial for accurate predictions. For house price prediction, regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Regression (SVR) are commonly used.
Model Training: Once you've selected a model, you train it on a dataset containing historical house prices and their corresponding features. During training, the model learns the patterns in the data to make predictions.
Model Evaluation: After training, you evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared (R2) score. This step helps you assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learned by the model during training. Hyperparameter tuning involves finding the optimal values for these parameters to improve the model's performance.
Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you deploy it to a production environment using Flask or Django. Users can then access the predictor through a web interface, where they input the relevant features of a house, and the model returns the predicted price.
